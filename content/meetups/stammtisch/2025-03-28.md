## For me?
***For everybody!*** No matter if you are an artist, designer, programmer, beginner, hobbyist, professional or anything in between: join us for sharing knowledge, creating art together, coding together, joining game jams together and having fun! üåº Fans of other platforms and engines are equally welcome.

## What to expect?
This is not a structured meeting, but rather a friendly get-together. A typical evening usually looks as follows...

{{< timeline >}}

{{< timelineItem icon="godot" header="Hello Godot!" badge="19:00" >}}
Say hello, find a chair, and get comfortable! 
You can get a drink and a snack from the donation-funded fridge (usually around EUR 1,-)
Also, if you are new or would like some guidance, let us know and we help you get settled in!
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< timelineItem icon="email" header="Who is who?" badge="19:20" >}}
A quick round of intros - find out what the others are about and say as much or as little as you like about yourself. What are your interests? What do you do with Godot?. 
{{< /timelineItem >}}

{{< timelineItem icon="lightbulb" header="Show & Tell!" badge="~5-10 minutes per" subheader="Got something to show?" >}}
Those that like can show off their latest projects, videos, art, or anything else they are working on. Feel free to ask questions!

There's a video projector and usually someone has a spare laptop if there are technical difficulties (or you don't have one).

{{< timelineItem icon="tag" header="Open-Ended Discussions" badge="open end" >}}
Switch rooms, form smaller groups, talk about anything you like!
