# Details
Welcome to our cosy Godot Engine Stammtisch! This is not a structured meeting, but rather a friendly get-together. We will hang out, chat and maybe show some of our current projects! 🦜

Regardless if you are an artist, designer, programmer, beginner, hobbyist, professional or anything in between: join us for sharing knowledge, creating art together, coding together, joining game jams together and having fun! 🌼

This meetup will happen at Berlin Creators / Individual Network Berlin, Lehrter Str. 53, 10557 Berlin-Moabit. 🌳

You can also join us via Discord on our Discord Server. ☎️

Follow us on Mastodon for updates. 📢

Please be excellent to each other! 🕊️
