We are a group of people passionate about the cross-platform, free and open-source Godot {{<icon "godot_color">}} game engine.

Regardless if you are an artist, designer, programmer, beginner, hobbyist, professional or anything in between: join us for sharing knowledge, creating art together, coding together, joining game jams together and having fun! 🚀

We strive to hold meetups at local Berlin makespaces every second and fourth Friday of the month. 🌳

It does not matter which engine you are using, or if you are using any engine at all: We are eager to see your awesome projects! ✨
